# Create a program that manages the work with SQLite databases using user input. 
# The program must be able to: 
#   - create connections to databases, 
#   - close the connections, and 
#   - execute a given SQL statement.

# To manage all the connections
#   - create a dict called connections, 
#   - store the 'filenames' of the databases as keys
#   - store the 'connection objects' as the values
#   - remove the dictionary item (key:value), everytime the connection is closed

# create a command list that prints out all avaliable commands

# 1. help 
#       returns list of commands

# 2. connect [database] 
#       creates a connection to [database]
#           if [database] exists, 
#           return msg
#
#           if error, 
#           return error
#
#           if successful, 
#           return msg 
#           add connection to dict
#
# 3. close [database]
#       close a connection to [database]
#           if connection not in [database]
#           return msg
#
#           if error, 
#           return error
#
#           if successful, 
#           return msg 
#           remove connection to dict           
#
# 3. execute [database] 'SQL statement'
#       execute a connection to [database]
#       create cursor
#       execute a command
#       commit
#           if connection not in [database]
#           return msg
#
#           if error, 
#           return error
#
#           if successful, 
#           return msg 
#
# 4. show 
#       print list of open database connection
#           if no connection 
#           return msg
#
# 5. exit 
#       close all connection
#       exit
#    
#
# try:
#   program
#
# except:
#   return msg
