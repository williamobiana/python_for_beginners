### What is a URL? ###
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator
it is the address of a given unique resource on the Web.
http://www.example.com:80/path/to/myfile.html?key1=value1&key2=value2#SomewhereInTheDocument

scheme = http://
authority = www.example.com:80
path to resource = /path/to/myfile.html
parameters = ?key1=value1&key2=value2
anchor = #SomewhereInTheDocument

### How to use a module? What are the uses? ###
https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/working-with-modules-in-python-must-known-fundamentals-for-data-scientists/#h2_6

The core idea of use modules is to minimize the code
We can break a complete code into separate parts, add to a module. 
and then we can call these modules in our main program logic.

example:
nano mymodule.py 
def welcome(name):
  print("Hello, " + name +" to Analytics Classes")

in script
import mymodule
mymodule.welcome(william)
# output: Hello william to Analytics Classes

or 

from mymodule import welcome
welcome(william)
# output: Hello william to Analytics Classes


### How is a module different from a package in Python? ###
### What are the benefits of using a package? ###
A module is a file containing Python functions. 
A package, is like a folder that holds modules and sub_pakages.
you can easliy share packages with other developers for them to use 


### What is a relational database? ###
Relational Database = Tables are structured related to each other.
means that tables in database are related using primary/foreign key relationship. 
Used to store, modify and retrieve data in the database.

Non-Relational Database =
There is no relation at all between tables
Mostly key+value pair : like jSon

## What is SQL? ###
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. 
Itâ€™s the language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data within relational databases.


### What is a Python virtual environment? ###
A virtual environment is a Python environment 
such that the Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated 
from those installed in other virtual environments,

example python3 is a virtual environment
